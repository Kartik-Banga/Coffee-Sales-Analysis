Coffee Sales Analysis

1. Worked with 3 worksheets: customers, orders, and products

2. In the orders worksheet, used (INDEX and MATCH) to populate values from customers, products to orders
   (Column name: Customer Name, Email, Country, Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price, Loyalty Card)
   ; used Customer ID and Product ID as the matching column. 

3. Used absolute referencing to avoid writing similar formula for Coffee Type, Roast Type, Size, Unit Price columns. 

4. Used IF conditions to write full names (Column name: Coffee Type Name, Roast Type Name).

5. Pivot tables and charts:

   a. Analyzed coffee sales of different types (Arabica, Excelsa, Librica, and Robusta) month-wise in the year 2019. ----- Line Chart
   
   b. Top 5 Customers w.r.t Sales ---- Bar Chart
   
   c. Sales by Country ----- Bar Chart

7. Dynamic Dashboard: 

   a. Used a timeline filter which allows the user to select particular year and months for analysis.
   
   b. Used Roast Type Name, Loyalty Card Status (Yes/No), Size as additional filtering options.
